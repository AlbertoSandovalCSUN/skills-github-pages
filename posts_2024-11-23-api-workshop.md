### The history of APIs

To start us off, Guzman briefly went over the history
of, the **_internet_**. Trying to build our intuition
on the **idea** of APIs. To sum up everything
he went over:
> The entire internet is built on one idea,
> file sharing. Companies have grown to make 
> businesses out of this simple idea but 
>  the internet simply acts as a way to access,
> exchange, and share files with others globally.

This idea did intrigue me quite a bit since it gave me 
a new perspective on something I am already familiar with.
Websites don't literally give you anything, at the end
of the day the internet and all of its contents are 
merely 1s and 0s. But given a file with exclusivity
or one that requires a trade-off, one may receive 
benefits beyond the digital world. This is the internal
philosophy behind things like online shopping. But
in what way does this relate to APIs? Well, this whole 
spiel about the philosophy of the internet does relate 
to APIs in one simple way: APIs simple access files.

### What is an API?
The acronym API stands for Application Programming Interface.
What it does is it allows programs that don't have data or **_files_**
built in to them to access files stored somewhere else on the internet,
usually in a database.
